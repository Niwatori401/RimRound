# RimRound Xpansion -- Mealtime v01.a

A small mini-mod based on adding some functionality and tweaks to RimRound.

This module will focus on food production and interactions. In particular, this mod aims to help consolidate meal production even further to enable mid-sized colonies to support the appetites of their growing colonists.

## Current Features (as of v01.a)
<ul>
<li>Added bulk cooking recipes for RimRound meals (large, huge, etc.). These recipes give a modest improvement in total work time at the cost of materiel.</li>
<li>Added a new cooking station -- the Industrial Stove -- for handling such large volumes of food in the meals. This is unlocked by a simple Industrial-era technology.</li>
<li>Added even larger vanilla meal recipes with further time, materiel, and skill trade-offs.</li>
</ul>

## Anticipated Features
<ul>
<li>Integration of Vanilla Cooking Expanded bulk recipes into either the Industrial Stove or a future workstation.</li>
<li>Addition of a patisserie bench, which will make more delicious (and potent) pastries for colonies that have the farm and cooking skill to produce. This will come in a version with VCE ingredient support.</li>
<li>A few drugs to interact with pawn appetite and eating -- both boosting and suppressing.</li>
<li>Pawn traits (such as current weight) making certain classes of foods prioritized when seeking to fulfill needs.</li>

### Required Mods
*Niwatori's RimRound*

### Recommended Mods
*Vanilla Cooking Expanded*

### Note on Graphical Assets (as of v01.a)
**The workbench art included in this version is not mine**, and **I do not intend to pass it off as my work**. It's the delightful work of Oskar Potocki and Trunken of the Vanilla Expanded team, repurposed from an older version of Vanilla Furniture's Production module. I will be making a new custom set of sprites for it before releasing the next version of this mod.
