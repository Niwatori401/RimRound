# RimRound - Alpha

RimRound is a mod for RimWorld aimed at adding weight gain and FA content to the game. Currently the mod implements the following features:

<ul>
  <li>20 weight stages representing weights all the way up to over three thousand pounds.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>13 custom spite sets drawn by @Bamboo-Ale including 7 stages with a form of clothing.</li>
    <li>Each stage applies a modifier to the pawn's hunger rate, need for rest and, at higher weights, their manipulation stat.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A dynamic fullness system which allows for stomach growth, bursting and stuffing.</li>
  <li>Eight sets of opinions on weight gain. Pawns have opinions on how big they'd like to be (or not!). Each stage of each opinion has flavor text written by rngsusd#9608</li>
  <li>Diet management! This mod includes a diet management gizmo that lets you choose between four management modes. Nutrition mode, fullness mode, hybrid and disabled. Their functionality is best seen in game.
  <li>Many settings to allow you to tweak your experience to your personal tastes, including tweaking values used by the mod as well as content settings.</li>
  <li>Various utilities to improve the experience such as the ability to show pawn bodies when they are in bed, change the way they lay when they sleep, and personally exclude them from using this mod's bodies. All of these can be hidden in the setings. </li>
  <li>Nutrition density! Foods can have differrent nutrition densities that reflect how calorie dense they are. Currently primarily implemented with Vanilla Cooking Expanded</li>
  <li>Two operations to remove body fat.</li>
  <li>A custom start screen! This can be toggled off in the RimWorld general settings.</li>
  <li>Several tweaks to general game operation to work better with how pawns look when they are huge</li>
  <br>
  
  <li>A feeding dispenser system which lets you liquify your food.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This feature is currently in testing! If you would like not to use it, remove the feeding tube .dll from your Assemblies folder.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

In the coming weeks and months content will continue to be added. Now that the core of the mod is becoming more stable I can focus on content. Either way, thank you for checking out the mod! If you have any problems or would like to discuss features, feel free to join the RimRound discord:
